# Binary Insertion Sort

For this project, I decided to work on a Binary Insertion Sort algorithm using python. 

Binary Insertion Sort uses binary search to find the proper location to insert the selected item at each iteration. 

We can use binary search to reduce the number of comparisons in normal insertion sort to make it much faster.
